# Motion activated flash + photo installation

I plan to build a motion activated photo and flash installation somewhere in the SF Campus: an interaction experience project that self generates imagery that is a cross between surveillance and stylized photography. 

## Summary

By utilizing a motion sensor as an input I will output a to servo motor. The servo will activate the shutter button of a camera which will take a burst of images. I will mount the camera and flash to a position relative to a standard surveillance camera. I plan on the motion senor to also output sound like a beep or chime to get the attention of the passerby, followed by an LED blink. The camera will be connected to my computer via a long usb cable if I cannot figure out how to make it happen wirelessly. I will be utilizing a software called Adobe Lightroom that has a tethering feature for real time image display. If possible, I want to make the images immediately visible to the subject to provide another layer of experience.

## Component Parts

I need to make an enclosure for a DSLR camera that is relatively discreet and be securely mounted as well as accurately positioned. 

- A PIR motion sensor or Xbox Connect. (INPUT)
(I ordered the sensor and reserved the Xbox Connect to be on the safe side.)
- A Servo Motor attached to a mechanical finger that applies sufficient pressure to the camera shutter button. 
- LED light
- Audio Shield, memory card and small speaker
- DSLR Camera and TTL external Flash.
- Laptop computer


## Challenges

<p> Finding a location and mounting the camera might be a little difficult, I want to be sure of my location as it impacts my overall setup and cord length. 
I have never experimented with motion sensors before, I looked a number of tutorials and feel confident enough with configuring the Arduino. There is a question of distance from the breadboard, and I am not too sure how to extend wiring. </p> 
Although I’ve never has a chance to use a 3D printer before, I want to create a finger-like structure to connect to the Servo. This is not 100% necessary because I can just as easily use 20 lb foam. I would just like to learn something new.
<p>I have also never explored Audio Shields, which I have not ordered yet, because it might not be a necessity.</p>

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal and place an order for any necessary components. Research location for installation on SF Campus.
- Week 2: Borrow wifi Arduino from Hybrid Lab and use comments to build a prototype circuit board. Borrow DSLR camera from Media Center to measure dimensions for custom rig. Finalize location for installation and fully realize what is possible for this project and make adjustments accordingly. If anything needs to be ordered as far as components, this will be the last week to do so.
- Week 3: Test a small scale setup of installation to ensure it works. Build 3D model or foam finger and build simple custom rig.
- Week 4: Test again in a controlled full scale setup installation and debug.
- Week 5: Present!
